The proposed system aims to address the challenge of providing accurate, accessible, and safe health guidance by analyzing user‑reported symptoms in natural language. This involves leveraging verified medical databases, AI‑driven health symptom analysis, and multilingual support to deliver reliable, educational, and referral‑based health recommendations. The solution will consist of the following components:
Data Collection:
 Collect user symptom descriptions via chat or voice, prompting follow‑up questions to clarify more details.
 Retrieve verified medical data from trusted sources like WHO, CDC, and government health portals by embedding Google search and provide evidence‑based suggestions.
Data Preprocessing:
Convert unstructured user descriptions into structured health data, handling typo errors, incomplete sentences, and multilingual inputs.
Extract key features such as symptom severity, duration, and related health factors for deeper analysis.
AI Symptom Analysis & Instruction Engine:
Provide step‑by‑step, instruction‑led guidance including probable causes, home remedies, urgency level, self‑care tips, and when to consult a doctor.
Deployment:
Build a multilingual, user‑friendly chatbot interface available on mobile and web platforms.
Integrate privacy, security, and compliance standards (HIPAA, GDPR) to protect sensitive health information.
Evaluation:
Measure accuracy, clarity of instructions, and user satisfaction against expert medical assessments.
Continuously improve the AI model and instruction logic with new medical data based on user feedback.
